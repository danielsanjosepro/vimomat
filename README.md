# Vimomat
a weekly vim (or else) motion, because every vim user knows that the addiction is real

### General Ideas
- Plugin that marks lines that solely contain #%% or # %% so that cells are clearly visible
- Treesitter integration with iron.nvim, so that i.e. <Space>-sB runs cell and jumps to next
