# Paste with P

One of the most annoying features of pasting with `p` is that you if you are in visual mode it will override the contents of your default clipboard after pasting and replacing with the text of the selected area.
To overcome that, you can use `P` to paste without replacing contents.

Example:
```python
foo = 12

def bar_func(bar1, bar2):
	print(bar1, bar2)
```
Now to replace bar with foo:
- yank foo,
- search for bar with /bar,
- replace bar by PnPnPnPnPn.
